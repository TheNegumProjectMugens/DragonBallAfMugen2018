			<b>XGargoyle's Introduction</b><br><br>

This character actually started as a joke, but immediately, we believed there was a lot of potential in him.<br>
The biggest challenge though, was to create an interesting character with a reduced number of sprites, and then we came up with ideas that had never been made in the other Z2 characters.<br><br>

As a Wizard character, Babidi is able to perform moves that will pose a challenge for the current Z2 roster, as well as being an interesting character to play with and against.<br><br>

We hope that you will enjoy this different approach to the Z2 style and that Babidi will provide you with new fighting strategies and good times.

<hr>

If you find infinites, please report.<br>
If you think some moves or combos are really unbalanced, please report or contact me, I will see what I can do.<br><br>

Note that this character was built for Winmugen (Plus). At this point, I cannot ensure everything will work correctly in Mugen 1.0, moreover in widescreen resolution. It will definitely have bugs if you play with it using Mugen 1.1, since the zooming feature isn't taken into account in this version of Babidi Z2.<br><br>
