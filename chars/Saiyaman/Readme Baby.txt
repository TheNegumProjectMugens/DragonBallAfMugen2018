----- Not to forget -----


Mugen is fun, but when u get older... u'll noticed that there's more important stuff than just mugen... 
enjoy while u can, don't be so hard to people who create their own chars using somebody else's codes... 
let others be the judge how good the char will be... 
u guys can't be angry forever just because of this small thing rite...

The brickbats anybody put on me, it's ok... i don't really mind, different people different opinions

To newbies... just be creative...

Thank you all... ;)
