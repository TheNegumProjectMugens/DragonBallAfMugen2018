Updated 2-26-08
Released 9-26-07


This is my third complete creation. Burter in the Choujin Style.
This character is made to play exactly like choujins DBZ chararacters
I was asked not to make all my characters play alike. 
This is my response. 

Burter varies with the addition of the Helper Jeice.

Jeice follows burter around and adds damage by doing attacks of his own.

Jeice can be called onto the screen anytime using the "Jeice" Command when burter has more than 1000 power.(calling him drains 600)  

To make burter not too powerful, Jeice constantly drains power. When power reaches zero, Jeice will leave.(also attacks done by Jeice do not increase the power meter.)

All Hypers change when jeice is available. With a special surprise in one.

----------------------------------------------
Update 2 -26-08
New SND With full array of sounds for both Burter and Jeice. Including intros and win poses
English SND included.
Added compatability with Ginyu's Change now.
Redid the counter to fix bug where p2 wouldnt get up if jeice missed..(jeice doesnt miss now, but just in case he does..p2 will still be able to get up)


Update 1 -2-08
AI updated......NO longer cheap.
Jeice actually uses his features.....however...his AI works independent of burter's. (Yes its humanly IMPOSSIBLE) to control him this way but its not that bad (compared to what he was at first)

Hit sprites have been rearranged correctly. Animations redone correctly.

Jeice can be put in to custom states..(BY OTHER CHOUJIN/STIG87) CHARACTERS!!!!
ALL current Hypers work on  HIM.  All Counters as well. Throws will make him disappear

Any other custom state not coded will make him disappear.

I am not going to account for what happens to him when you aren't playing a DBZ Dream Character.

As Requests.........Jeice now has a editable pallette. I know some of my schemes may be a bit odd, but its just to show that he has pallettes now........Play with them if u like.

Many changes in code to Decrease the bugs dealing with Jeice.

NOTES


The charge is still available with jeice but the power drain puts a nice delay in any gain of power....so its quite risky... Maybe  useful if opponent is down and u dont want jeice power to drain 

Burter can execute combos quite well (maybe too well). You should be able to chain a nice variety of custom combos.


I'm trying my best to ensure that there are enough provisions in place to ensure that the addition of jeice doesnt make Burter too powerful, While giving him and interesting style of gameplay
