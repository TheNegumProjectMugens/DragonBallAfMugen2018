;Crouching light punch
; CNS difficulty: easy
; Description: Simple crouching attack. The HitDef's guardflag parameter
;     is set to "L", meaning that the move can only be guarded low
;     (crouching), and not by standing or jumping opponents.
;     Like for all light attacks, it's a good idea to keep the slidetime
;     and hittime parameters at a smaller number, so the opponent isn't
;     stunned for too long. For all crouching attacks you have to
;     remember to set the attr parameter to indicate that it is crouching
;     attack. In this case, "C, NA" stands for "crouching, normal attack".
;     The HitDef's priority is set at 3, instead of the default of 4,
;     so this attack has a lower priority than most others, meaning
;     KFM will get hit instead of trading hits with his opponent if
;     their attack collision boxes (Clsn1) intersect each other's Clsn2

;Kung Fu Throw - Attempt
; CNS difficulty: medium-advanced
; Description: Throws are not difficult to make, although then can be
;     tedious at times. Throw attempt states have a HitDef of a
;     special format. The key parameters in a throw are p1stateno
;     and p2stateno. If the HitDef successfully connects, then
;     the attacker will change to the state number specified by
;     p1stateno, and the opponent will be change to the state
;     number assigned to p2stateno. The special thing about p2stateno
;     is that the opponent will be temporarily brought into the
;     attacker's state file. In this case, no matter who the
;     opponent is, he will be taken to state 820 of this file (kfm.cns)
;     and remain here until the end of the throw (look at his debug
;     information when he is being thrown; the text changes to yellow
;     to mean that he is in another player's state file).

; Notes: The '-' symbol in the hitflag field means that it only affects

;   1 or 2, so that the throw does not take precedence over normal attacks.
;   The type of priority must always be set to "Miss" or "Dodge" for throws,

;Kung Fu Throw - Throwing the opponent
; Description: In this state, KFM throws the opponent by binding him to
;     various offsets based on his current frame of animation. For
;     example, [State 810, Bind 1] binds the opponent to an offset of
;     28 pixels in front of KFM. That puts him around where KFM's hand
;     is at. Is is important to keep the opponent bound using a
;     TargetBind controller at all times, until you let him go. This
;     is especially important if your player has a Clsn2 box that
;     allows him to get hit while throwing someone. Each time a player
;     gets hit, all his bound targets will be set to a fall state. If
;     the opponent is not bound, then he may get stuck in his thrown
;     state when his attacker is knocked out of the throw halfway.
; Notes: There is a TargetLifeAdd controller to decrease the opponent's
;     life, and a TargetState controller to change his state to a
;     falling state when KFM lets go of him.

;Thrown by Kung Fu Throw
; (a custom gethit state)
; Description: This is the state that the opponent changes to after being
;     hit by KFM's throw HitDef. The important thing here is to use a
;     ChangeAnim2 controller. The difference between ChangeAnim2 and
;     ChangeAnim is that ChangeAnim2 changes the player's animation to
;     an action in the AIR file of the attacker (in this case, kfm.air),
;     whereas ChangeAnim always changes the player to an action in his
;     own AIR file. Look at Action 820 in kfm.air for some extra
;     comments.
