2- Identity of the character
============================



We see Vegito when Goku and Vegeta fuse using the Potara Earrings. 
They would never have fused knowing that they could never again separate but they knew 
they had to in order to defeat Majin Buu. When Buu absorbed Vegito they happened to 
defuse. Vegeta and Goku then crushed the Potara Earrings.
