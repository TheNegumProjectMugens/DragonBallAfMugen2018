Hi All!

Well, sorry for this mess. I can't do what I want to without sprites. Till I get some, here's my W.I.P version, 0.81b. It has some bugfixes
(If you are in a helpful mood, and you can draw sprites well, you can contact me via pm's on M.I., ShugenDo forums, and Mugen Fighters Guild)

Added new effects
Some others I can't remember.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Combo Rushes (20% done & Super)
Definition:
Broly can do a short, continious combo of hits.
Button Config: D, DF, F, y
                       D, DF, F, x (Not Done)
                       D, DF, F, a (Not Done)
                       D, DF, F, b (Not Done)
                       D, DF, F, c (Not Done)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Expanding Energy Blast (Hyper Lvl2)
Definition:
Broly charges some KI into his hand, and shots a
projectile above his enemy's head! Then the ball
spreads into 20 KI Pellets, which can do respectable
damage. In version 0.8b it's modified a bit.
Button Config : D, DB, B, F, y
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Artifical Intelligence (Basic)
Definition:
If Broly's controlled by the computer, then he plays like an intelligent
player, instead of the basic "ipresseverybutton" gaming style. In version
0.8b it's modified a bit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- KI Bomb Lvl 1 (Hyper Lvl1)
Definition:
Broly Charges a ball of energy in his hand,
then he punches it towards his opponent.
Button Config : D, DB, B, F, a 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- KI Bomb Lvl 2 (Hyper Lvl2)
Definition:
Just like the Lvl 1 KI Bomb, but this time,
Broly has a green aura, and charges the
projectile longer.
Button Config : D, DB, B, F, b
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- KI Bomb Lvl 3 (Hyper Lvl3)
Definition:
The strongest hyper in this category. Broly screams
with sound on the maximum, then charges his KI Bomb, 
and after this, he sends the Ball'O'Death with a stylish 
punch. Better avoid this projectile, when you play againts him.
Button Config : D, DB, B, F, c
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Eraser Cannon (Hyper Lvl1-Lvl2)
Definition:
Broly forces some of his powers to his hand, and after some
charge, he launch an arrow-like projectile. Now you can choose
how long you want to charge the move (so no lvl 1/2/3 needed)
Button Config : D, DB, B, F, x 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Sayan's Fury Mode (Hyper Lvl3)
Definition: The idea of this move was in my mind since the
beginning of this project. Broly Charges, then his attack power
rises about the 1.5x from the original. During the use of the move,
he can't use any hypers, but the Supers change a bit. And
he won't lean back from attacks, can counter instantly.The
standing anim changes too (It maybe sucks). And the basic
counter system doesn't work as well during the session.
Button Config: a+x (You need at least 500 power to use)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rapid Kishots (Super)
Definition: If you want to finish your opponent quckly,
the this move is optional. It can shoot 8 KI Bullets at
the cost of 10 (Takes 500 power), but with awesome 
speed.
Button Config: B, F, z
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Air Dash (Basic)
Definition:
You can now dash in the air. Press U or D buttons to travel
Up or Down during the dash.
Button Config: F,F (Foward); B,B (Back) + U or D
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- KI Charge (Basic)
Definition : Broly unleashes his hidden powers, to show
who's boss (Gives power gradually)
Button Config: c+z
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Basic Combo System (Basic)
Definition: You can switch from weak attacks
to medium attacks, medium to strong, etc.
Kicks have more power (for example : you can switch from
weak punch to weak kick, but kishots aren't in combo, 
cuz they are supers)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Basic Counter System (60% done & Basic)
Definition:
Broly can counter now, if you press the a,x or y button 
three times (b and c buttons will be made).
You can counter in the air with a or y, but they are more
expensive than x, because x can only used on the ground!
(If you are using Sayan's Fury mode, this feature is disabled)
Button Config: a*3, x*3, or y*3 when got hit.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 1 Button Combination System (70% done & Basic) 
Definition
You can do a short combo with (almost) every button, just for
showing off.
Button Config:
a,a,a
x,x,f
y,y,f
x,x,y,y,f
x,x,a,a,y,y,f
c,c,f
x,x,a,a,y,y,c,c,f (If you're lucky)
*f=finish can be any button included within this system,
but the finish is got to be equal or weaker than your combo
so, you can't switch from x,x to y finish, or x,x to a finish.
Well, there's maybe more, but you'll have to
find them out by yourself! In 0.7a the c,c combo added.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Intro
Definition:
When the round starts, Broly will transform from his normal
form to his legendary form.
