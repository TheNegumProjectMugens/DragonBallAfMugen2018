Character's History

Son Gohan is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball universe created by Akira Toriyama as a protagonist 
for the media franchise, which consists of a series of manga, anime, soundtracks, movies, television specials, 
video games, and other collectibles. Gohan is introduced as the first son of the primary protagonist, Son Goku, 
and his wife, Chi Chi, in volume #17 of the original manga, or the premiere episode of its animated adaptation, 
Dragon Ball Z. Gohan is the first Saiyan/Human hybrid in the series.

CAUTION:

All the sourse, fx and sprites made by Dgz Team is NOT OPEN SOURSE
If you wanna use fxs like auras, charges kames, kames, masenko, explosion, and others original stuff, YOU MUST HAVE
OWN PERMISSION OF THE DGZ TEAM.
If you use the fxs without my permission you will have problems.
Sorry but we want originality and own style to do mugen stuff...

My opinion: The open sourse is good for newbies and for use a few classic stuff... 
BUT if you're pretend to use all open sourse key, then you're a weak guy without originality... 
you're killing mugen and abuse the works of others cool guys. just PATHETHIC....
My recomendation: learn to do your own stuff.

Mugen is fun, but when u get older... u'll noticed that there's more important stuff than just mugen... 
let others be the judge how good the char will be... 

The brickbats anybody put on me, it's ok... i don't really mind, different people different opinions

To newbies... just be creative... don't abuse... and enjoy!

Thanks you all... ;)
