======================================

Unofficial History: Descended from the Demon Realm, Firebrand was raised to seek power and to become the last demon standing. Following his defeat in the earth realm by the Knight Arthur, Firebrand returned to his own realm and succeeded in defeating every other gargoyle demon for the right to own the Demon Crests. Now as the possessor of the Water and Earth Crest, Firebrand continues to fight on a quest to secure the remaining demon quests in order to form them into the Infinity Crest with unmatched, infinite power. Firebrand is not an evil creature, he simply does what any other gargoyle demon would do, only he does it better.
